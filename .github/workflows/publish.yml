          **npm registry**: \`$NPM_VERSION\`
          **GitHub release**: \`$GITHUB_RELEASE\`

          ### Impact
          The published package version on npm doesn't match the GitHub release version. This indicates a problem with semantic-release.

          ### Likely Causes
          1. semantic-release published to npm but GitHub release step failed
          2. GitHub release created but npm publish step failed
          3. Race condition or timing issue

          ### Fix
          1. Check workflow logs for semantic-release errors
          2. Verify both plugins ran successfully:
             - \`@semantic-release/npm\` (publishes to registry)
             - \`@semantic-release/github\` (creates release + git tags)

          ### Workflow Run
          https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}" \
              --label "bug,release,critical"

            exit 1
          fi

          echo "✅ npm registry matches GitHub release"
          echo "✅ Post-publish verification PASSED"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
